# Tic Tac Toe Game – JavaScript Version 🎮❌⭕️

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in **JavaScript**, built by following a YouTube tutorial to understand game logic, conditional flow, and interactive code structures.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Is

This is a JavaScript version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game that runs in the console or browser (depending on environment).  
It was built to explore logic for turn taking, win detection, and state management while learning JS fundamentals.

---

## 👇 How the Game Works

- Two players take turns (X and O).
- Players mark positions on a 3×3 grid.
- The code determines when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- No GUI yet — this is about practicing game logic in JavaScript itself.

---

## 📌 Tech Used

- **JavaScript** – main language  
- No HTML/CSS included in this version

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhura-23/TIKTACTOE2.git
2.Navigate into it

```cd TIKTACTOE2```

3.Open the JS file in an editor or run using Node:

```node <yourFileName>.js```


If you want a visual browser version, HTML and CSS can be added later!
